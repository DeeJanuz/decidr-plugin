# Unreleased

- **feat**: Parent renderer refresh on SlideOut mutations — dashboard and graph auto-refresh when entities are changed, deleted, or approved from the slide-out panel

# 0.1.4

- **fix**: `my_action_items` tool_rule now directs agents to ALWAYS push to `decidr_list` — removes ambiguous dashboard suggestion that caused agents to open `decidr_dashboard` for action item requests
- **fix**: Action Items tool_group hint clarified to reference `decidr_list` instead of "Dashboard"
- **feat**: `plugin_rules` — two high-level behavioral rules that agents see every session: action items always go to `decidr_list`, entity views always go to `decidr_list`, dashboard/graph only on explicit request
